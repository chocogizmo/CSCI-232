the GUI I made might be a little janky, so here's some notes for it:

1) you might have to click on the display options a couple of times before the result shows up. No idea why
2) hopefully the printTree is readable enough. but I'm exhuasted so I don't care
3)In order to use the Search, add, and delete functions, put a number into the textfield on the left and then press
	whichever option you want 

anyway yikes this was a killer
